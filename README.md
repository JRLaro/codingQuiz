# codingQuiz


## Description 

> During this assignment, I created a quiz game based off one of my favorite t.v shows "The Office". The project opens up with the fairly simple objective, and once the User clicks on the button "Start Quiz" - the quiz begins. The user has a 75 second countdown to answer the 7 questions that are prompted, but beware, if the User gets a question incorrect they are penalized 10 seconds.  


Test your knowledge and answer the following "The Office" questions. See for yourself - Check it out:
